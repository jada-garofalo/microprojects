little projects i tinker with while i'm bored over the weekends

### wikiScraper.py - can't think of what to read?
this little chunk of code takes a specific wikipedia article (in this case the NGE page), searches for another wikipedia page in the text body, and enters the new article. rinse and repeat this process ad infinitum (until it spits an error or you ctrl+c) and you've got a basically limitless list of articles to read :)\

in its current state it does get angry after a lot of searches reaching some arbitrary limit, or after it reaches a page with no viable links :/
